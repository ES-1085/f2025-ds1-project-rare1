## 1. Introduction

Promise Early Education is a program designated for low-income or
vulnerable families in the Lewiston-Auburn area. They provide education
to income-eligible children who receive social services, such as the
SNAP program, from the government. Along with educating children, they
provide services to students with mental health and learning
disabilities. Additionally, Promise also provides health and nutritional
support for children.

To assess the students, Promise uses the GOLD assessment system. The
GOLD system tracks students’ development over time in specific areas
such as social-emotional, physical, cognitive, and language abilities.
It tracks students on a widely held expectation (WHE) score to determine
if they are below, meeting, or exceeding developmental expectations. The
data collected is specifically targeted for students aged 0-5, and
includes raw scores, scaled scores, and national norm comparison. This
data is then utilized in the classroom to help teachers create lesson
plans and give individualized attention, all to support the children’s
development.

For this project, our research question will explore children’s
development progress in the Promise Early Education program. We will
analyze and evaluate the developmental gains of three key populations:
Dual Language Learners (DLLs), students receiving special education
services (those with an Individualized Education Program, or IEP),
multi-year participants, and students of different racial/ethnic
backgrounds. By comparing the progress of these subgroups against their
peers, this research aims to illuminate how different student
populations are supported in the classroom. Some questions we hope to
investigate are:

1.  How does the progress of dual language learners differ from their
    peers?

2.  What are the weakest/strongest skill sets of dual language learners
    compared to standard expectations (categorized by physical,
    social-emotional, literacy, etc.)

3.  How does the progress across a year differ for a multi-year student
    compared to a first time student?

4.  What are the effects of IEP students on non-IEP students in the
    classroom?

5.  How does growth for students compare by different seasons (fall to
    winter, winter to spring)?

6.  Are there differences in progress between students of different
    races?

## 2. Data

Text goes here. Place your data in the /data folder, and add dimensions
and codebook to the README in that folder. Then print out the output of
glimpse() or skim() of your data frame.

## 3. Data analysis plan

Text goes here. - What variables will you visualize to explore your
research questions? - Will there be any other data that you need to find
to help with your research question? - Very preliminary exploratory data
analysis, including some summary statistics and visualizations, along
with some explanation on how they help you learn more about your data.
(You can add to these later as you work on your project.) - The data
visualization(s) that you believe will be useful in exploring your
question(s). (You can update these later as you work on your project.)
