## Summary

Promise Early Education is a non-profit organization based in the Lewiston-Auburn area, focused on providing equitable access to early education for low income families in vulnerable socio-economic situations. Promise also provides disability and mental health services, family advocacy, health and nutrition support, and connects families with essential community resources, ensuring a holistic approach to children's well-being

Focusing on the critical role early education plays in a child’s overall development, they use the GOLD assessment to quantify the student’s progress throughout participation in their program. The GOLD assessment focuses on 6 developmental categories: social and emotional, physical, cognitive, mathematics, and language and literacy development. Students are evaluated using the widely held expectations (WHE) standard for each domain, and can score under, meeting, or exceeding expectations. The purpose of collecting WHE scores is to understand which behaviors and skills children can generally be expected to demonstrate in the classroom.

Due to consistency issues across different time periods and categories, we chose to focus on progress for the Early Head Start Program (ages 0-3) across the 2024-2025 year rather than more longitudinally. The primary goal of this project is to quantify the developmental impact of Promise Early Education's comprehensive services on its Early Head Start participants during this time period.
