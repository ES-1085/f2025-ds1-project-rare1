## 1. Introduction

Promise Early Education is a program designated for low-income or
vulnerable families in the Lewiston-Auburn area. They provide education
to income-eligible children who receive social services, such as the
SNAP program, from the government. Along with educating children, they
provide services to students with mental health and learning
disabilities. Additionally, Promise also provides health and nutritional
support for children.

To assess the students, Promise uses the GOLD assessment system. The
GOLD system tracks students’ development over time in specific areas
such as social-emotional, physical, cognitive, and language abilities.
It tracks students on a widely held expectation (WHE) score to determine
if they are below, meeting, or exceeding developmental expectations. The
data collected is specifically targeted for students aged 0-5, and
includes raw scores, scaled scores, and national norm comparison. This
data is then utilized in the classroom to help teachers create lesson
plans and give individualized attention, all to support the children’s
development.

For this project, our research question will explore children’s
development progress in the Promise Early Education program. We will
analyze and evaluate the developmental gains of three key populations:
Dual Language Learners (DLLs), students receiving special education
services (those with an Individualized Education Program, or IEP),
multi-year participants, and students of different racial/ethnic
backgrounds. By comparing the progress of these subgroups against their
peers, this research aims to illuminate how different student
populations are supported in the classroom. Some questions we hope to
investigate are:

1.  How does the progress of dual language learners differ from their
    peers?

2.  What are the weakest/strongest skill sets of dual language learners
    compared to standard expectations (categorized by physical,
    social-emotional, literacy, etc.)

3.  How does the progress across a year differ for a multi-year student
    compared to a first time student?

4.  What are the effects of IEP students on non-IEP students in the
    classroom?

5.  How does growth for students compare by different seasons (fall to
    winter, winter to spring)?

6.  Are there differences in progress between students of different
    races?

## 2. Data

Because of the complex structure of the original dataset, we chose to
clean and organize the data in Google Sheets rather than R to simplify
the reformatting process. Specifically, we created new columns
indicating “yes” or “no” for Dual Language Learners, race, and
multi-year students. We also cleaned by consolidating data from all
Early Head Start (EHS) programs into unified columns, because the
original dataset had some categories arranged in columns and others in
rows.

`Category` = `which aspect is being tested` `WHE Bottom` =
`Bottom widely held expectation scores` `WHE Top` =
`Top widely held expectation scores` `Average` = `Average scores`
`# Children` = `Number of children being tested` `# Below` =
`Number of students below average` `% Below` =
`Percent of students below average` `# Meeting` =
`Number of students meeting expectations` `% Meeting` =
`Percentage of students meeting expectations` `# exceeding` =
`Number of students exceeding expectations` `% exceeding` =
`The percentage of students exceeding expectations` `Time period` =
`Fall, winter, or spring trimesters` `Age range` =
`The age range of the students` `White` =
`If the student is white or not` `Dual Language` =
`If the student is a dual language learner or not` `Multi-Year` =
`If the student is a Multi-Year student or not`

## 3. Data analysis plan

The variables we will be visualizing to explore the research questions
include: `Dual Language` `Dual Language`, `category`, and `Average`
`Multi-year` X (TBD- waiting for IEP data) .`Time period` `White`

Other data needed:

We hope to explore IEP students’ development, but we are currently
waiting for Early Head Start to upload the data for the 2024-2025 year.
This will be variable number 6 which is TBD currently.

Types of graphs we may want to use:

-Line plot - to show the distribution of scores deviating away from the
average for each `category` - Waffle plots - To compare multi-year and
not multi-year students -Box Plot - showing the range of average scores
-Bar Graph - to compare students meeting, exceeding, and below
expectations - Bar Graph - to compare differences among distinctions
like race and language

``` r
EHS_with_race |>
  mutate(Race_Group = if_else(`White (Yes or No)` == "Yes", "White", "Non-White")) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = Category, y = Average, fill = Race_Group)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge")+
  labs(
    title = "Average GOLD Assessment Scores by Category and Race",
    x = "Category",
    y = "Average Score",
    fill = "Race"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() 
```

![](proposal_files/figure-gfm/preliminary-exploratory-data-analysis-bar-graph-1.png)<!-- -->
Our first preliminary exploratory data analysis is a bar graph comparing
GOLD assessment scores between races. This visualization shows that
generally, scores are similar between races, but white students tend to
do slightly better in each category, excluding mathematics, where
non-white students preform better. Exploring this graph is useful as it
showed us the limitations of what visualizations work and don’t work
with data regarding race, for example, a ridge plot would not be able to
show this data because we don’t have enough average data points.
