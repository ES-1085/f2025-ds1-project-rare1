## 1. Introduction

Promise Early Education is a program designated for low-income or
vulnerable families in the Lewiston-Auburn area. They provide education
to income-eligible children who receive social services, such as the
SNAP program, from the government. Along with educating children, they
provide services to students with mental health and learning
disabilities. Additionally, Promise also provides health and nutritional
support for children.

To assess the students, Promise uses the GOLD assessment system. The
GOLD system tracks students’ development over time in specific areas
such as social-emotional, physical, cognitive, and language abilities.
It tracks students on a widely held expectation(WHE) score to determine
if they are below, meeting, or exceeding developmental expectations. The
data collected is specifically targeted for students aged 0-5, and
includes raw scores, scaled scores, and national norm comparison. This
data is then utilized in the classroom to help teachers create lesson
plans and give individualized attention, all to support the children’s
development.

For this project, our research question will explore children’s
development progress in the Promise Early Education program.
Specifically, we will analyze the classroom progress of children with
special needs (those who qualify for an Individual Education Program, or
an IEP) and dual language learners, comparing their progress in the
classroom with their peers. We hope that our results highlight how
different student populations are supported and developed in classroom
settings. Some questions we hope to investigate are:

1.  How does the progress of students with IEPs differ from their peers
    without IEPs?

2.  What are the effects of IEP students on non-IEP students in the
    classroom?

3.  Are there differences in IEP student progress before and after
    COVID-19?

4.  Are there differences in dual language learners’ progress before and
    after COVID-19?

5.  What are the differences between dual language learners and single
    language students?

6.  How do IEP students and non-IEP students compare to national
    standards?

## 2. Data

Text goes here. Place your data in the /data folder, and add dimensions
and codebook to the README in that folder. Then print out the output of
glimpse() or skim() of your data frame.

## 3. Data analysis plan

Text goes here. - What variables will you visualize to explore your
research questions? - Will there be any other data that you need to find
to help with your research question? - Very preliminary exploratory data
analysis, including some summary statistics and visualizations, along
with some explanation on how they help you learn more about your data.
(You can add to these later as you work on your project.) - The data
visualization(s) that you believe will be useful in exploring your
question(s). (You can update these later as you work on your project.)
